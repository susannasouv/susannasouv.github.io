    <h2>Virta Health</h2>
	<em>Python (Flask), Javascript/Typescript (React)</em>
    <h3>Software engineer, full-stack</h3>
    January 2018 - August 2023<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Created an EHR system ("Spark Notes") for care team members to quickly document key interactions with patients and decisions made about their care, including the ability to direct an alert about a specific note to the patient's coach or provider.</li>
	    <li>Enabled accessible, less error-prone account creation for Spark (the internal tool for coaches and providers) by creating a form.</li>
	    <ul>
            <li>The form also became the template for creating internal patient accounts.</li>
            <li>Previously, account creation was done by engineers who tunneled into a database. With the form, IT was able to take on the responsibility of account creation.</li>
        </ul>
	    <li>Mentored an employee outside of the engineering department and completed a project that was previously de-prioritized.</li>
	    <ul>
          <li>Created a new account type in Spark for Enrollment Advisors at Virta and introduced role-based access to information in Virtapedia, the source of truth on Virta-related clinical information and workflows.</li></ul>
          <li>Enabled coaches to start the release process from a patient's profile, including adding an at-a-glance indicator and automated reminders for key workflow steps.</li>
	    <ul>
        <li>Also added a system to automatically flag patients who were "at risk of release" due to engagement or eligibility reasons and generate alerts with key workflow steps to re-engage patients.</li>
       </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>ClearSlide</h2>

        <li>Created components in React to migrate frontend off of AngularJS</li>
        <li>Was the go-to engineer for issues with the ClearSlide Slack integration</li>
